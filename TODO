* Investigate gfx_navi_ambi.bin (the only gfx file whose size isn't a multiple of 16)
    * In general, make sure gfx decompression is 100% correct.
    * Getting recompression working 100% would be ideal to verify that...

* Scripts in bank $15 could change unreliably when relocated, due to the variance on where
  "jump" commands go to (they either jump locally or to bank $c). Figure out how to fix this.
* Fix capitalization for variables named based on their addresses (inconsistent)
* Investigate compression:
    - Each room layout group ("plane") has $4000 bytes for its data (pointers use 14
      bits). Uncompressed small rooms can use up to $5000 bytes. Investigate further.
        - Large layout groups should have $10000 bytes.
* Interactions:
    - Should be possible to have interaction ids greater than $ef, not supported yet
      though
* WLA:
    - Add an option to optimize all "ld a,($ffxx)" opcodes to "ldh a,($xx)"


* QOL stuff (in a different branch):
    * Make chest items always have the correct spawn mode
    * Have a completely separate tileset for each area (like ZOLE)
    * Bugfixes:
    	* "calculateRoomEdge" function flawed?
