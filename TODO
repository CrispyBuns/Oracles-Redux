Before Release:

- Dump scripts
- Make tileset compression work
- Makefile:
  - Don't fail when directories don't exist
- Text parser:
	- Warn when lines are too long
	- It's not pure ASCII, find exceptions (like tilde)
- Interactions:
    - Should be possible to have interaction ids greater than $ef, not
      supported yet though

Other:

- Documentation:
  - Consider using callab everywhere (replace all calls to interBankCall)
